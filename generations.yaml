    description: "The original Ford Puma was a small sport compact coupe based on the fourth-generation Fiesta platform. Designed by Ian Callum, it featured distinctive styling with bulbous headlights and flowing curves that set it apart from its contemporaries. Primarily powered by a series of Yamaha-developed 1.4L, 1.6L, and 1.7L Zetec-SE engines producing between 90 and 155 HP, it emphasized handling and driving enjoyment over outright power. The limited-production Racing Puma, developed by Ford's Special Vehicle Engineering division, featured widened bodywork, Alcon brakes, a revised suspension, and a 155 HP 1.7L engine. The interior was driver-focused with supportive seats and a sporty instrument cluster. Despite its relatively short production run, the original Puma gained cult status among enthusiasts for its exceptional handling, distinctive design, and character, with approximately 133,000 units produced exclusively for European markets."

  - name: "Second Generation (Crossover)"
    start_year: 2019
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Puma revived the nameplate for a completely different vehicle type—a subcompact crossover SUV based on the seventh-generation Fiesta platform. The exterior design incorporates some styling cues recalling the original Puma, particularly in the canoe-shaped headlights, but with a higher-riding crossover profile. Powered primarily by Ford's 1.0L EcoBoost three-cylinder engine with 48V mild-hybrid technology in various power outputs (125-155 HP), it prioritizes efficiency while maintaining engaging driving dynamics. The performance-oriented ST variant features a 1.5L EcoBoost three-cylinder producing 200 HP. A distinctive feature is the 'MegaBox'—an 80-liter waterproof, drainable storage compartment beneath the cargo floor, adding significant versatility. The interior shares elements with the Fiesta but with a more crossover-appropriate seating position and available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 8-inch SYNC 3 touchscreen. Trim levels range from the entry-level Titanium to the sporty ST-Line and more rugged Active variants. This generation represents Ford's strategy to leverage recognizable nameplates while transitioning its European lineup toward crossovers and SUVs. While sharing nothing mechanically with its predecessor, the current Puma has been commercially successful by combining the engaging driving characteristics Ford is known for with the practical aspects and raised driving position of a crossover."
